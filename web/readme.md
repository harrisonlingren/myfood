# MyRecipes, web

Welcome to the Web app portion of this project!

I'm currently building out this section using [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react) paired with [Next.js](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) for super-fast server-side rendering!

You can check out my progress by visiting [beta.myrecipes.pw](http://beta.myrecipes.pw).
